# Project for class Programiranje 2

## Server functionality

This project is an implementation of a server that can 
communicate with other servers logged in to the main server. 
The desired result is uninterupted exchange of sequence 
information between various servers, each possessing disparate sequences.

It can handle the following `GET` requests:
- `/ping`: responds with the information about the server including: `name` and `address`,
- `/sequence`: provides the information about available sequences,

and the following `POST` request:
- `/sequence`: returns a vector of floating point numbers, 
according to the specified sequence and range.

## Running the Server

Starting the server requires use of the following command in the
 terminal: 
 `cargo run -- register_address generator_ip generator_port`,
 where the defaults are `127.0.0.1:7878`, `127.0.0.1` and `9000` respectively.

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure that the main server is up and running
 before starting, so as to make sure, that this server logs in to the
 main server.

In the `machine\tests` folder there is an existing `test.py` 
file with pre-written tests for each available sequence, that
 can be modified, should one request a sequence located on 
 another server.

 amount.  
> _Parameters:_ 
> 1

> _Description:_ 
> Fibonacci sequence starting with given parameters `zeroth` and
 `first`.  
> _Parameters:_ 
>  2  
> _Sequences:_ 
>  0

> __Floor sequence__  
> _Description:_ 
> A sequence that takes one sequences and applies the floor function 
term by term.  
> _Parameters:_ 
>  0  
> _Sequences:_ 
>  1

> __Geometric sequence__  
> _Description:_ 
> Geometric sequence with two parameters: a start and a 
quotient.  
> _Parameters:_ 
>  2  
> _Sequences:_ 
>  0

> __Linear Combination sequence__  
> _Description:_ 
> Linear combination of two sequences `a` and `b` as given by:
 `(x*a_i + y*b_i + w)_i` where `x`, `y` and `w` are the three 
 parameters.  
> _Parameters:_ 
>  3  
> _Sequences:_ 
>  2

> __Max sequence__

term by term.  
> _Parameters:_ 
>  0  
> _Sequences:_ 
>  2

> __Min sequence__  
> _Description:_ 
> A sequence that takes two sequences and uses their minimum 
term by term.  
> _Parameters:_ 
>  0  
> _Sequences:_ 
>  2

> __Product sequence__  
> _Description:_ 
> A sequence that takes two sequences and multiplies them term 
by term.  
> _Parameters:_ 
>  0  
> _Sequences:_ 
>  2

> __Random sequence__  
> _Description:_ 
>A sequence that takes two arguments: `a` and `b`, and generates random values
 in a specified range `[min(a, b), max(a,b))`. If the range is empty it 
 returns all a's.  
> _Parameters:_ 
>  2  
> _Sequences:_ 
>  0

> __Sum sequence__  
> _Description:_ 
> A sequence that takes two sequences and adds them term by term.  
> _Parameters:_ 
>  0  
> _Sequences:_ 
>  2

> [!NOTE]
> All sequences that could logically take an arbitrary amount of sequences are implemented in such a way, however the project restrictions make it unfeasible.
